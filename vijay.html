  Zakir Abdul Karim Naik (born 18 October 1965) is an Indian Islamic da'i and orator who focuses on comparative religion.[9] Naik is currently a wanted fugitive in India, where, in 2016, the authorities charged Naik for money laundering while he was abroad in Malaysia; Naik did not return to India and became a permanent resident of Malaysia.[10][11][12] Naik denies all charges. The National Investigation Agency attempted to issue an Interpol red notice for his arrest, which was refused due to insufficient evidence.[13]
